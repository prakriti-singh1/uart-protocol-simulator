# UART Protocol Simulator (Verilog)

This project implements a **Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)** protocol in Verilog, simulating both the **transmitter (TX)** and **receiver (RX)** modules with loopback testing. It is designed as a **core ECE project**, demonstrating digital communication principles, finite state machines (FSM), and timing-based serial protocols.

> ✅ Verified using Vivado 2025.1  
> 💻 Suitable for FPGA implementation or behavioral simulation

| `uart_tx.v`       | UART transmitter: sends 8-bit data with START and STOP bits using FSM      |
| `uart_rx.v`       | UART receiver: detects start bit, samples incoming bits at mid-bit timing  |
| `uart_loopback.v` | Top-level module connecting TX and RX internally for simulation            |
| `tb_uart.v`       | Testbench for simulating UART loopback with output display and timeout     |
